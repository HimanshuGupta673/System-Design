### Strategy Design Pattern vs. Bridge Design Pattern

#### Strategy Design Pattern
The Strategy Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to define a family of algorithms, put each of them into a separate class, and make their objects interchangeable. It lets the algorithm vary independently from the clients that use it.

#### Bridge Design Pattern
The Bridge Pattern is a structural design pattern that separates an object's abstraction from its implementation, allowing them to vary independently. It decouples the interface from the implementation, promoting flexibility and scalability.

### Key Differences
1. **Purpose**:
   - **Strategy Pattern**: Used to select an algorithm at runtime.
   - **Bridge Pattern**: Used to separate abstraction from implementation so they can change independently.

2. **Focus**:
   - **Strategy Pattern**: Focuses on how behavior is implemented and swapped dynamically.
   - **Bridge Pattern**: Focuses on separating abstraction and implementation into different class hierarchies.

3. **Use Case**:
   - **Strategy Pattern**: Best used when you have multiple ways to perform an operation and you need to switch between them.
   - **Bridge Pattern**: Best used when you need to vary both an abstraction and its implementation independently.

### Command Design Pattern
The Command Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that turns a request into a stand-alone object that contains all information about the request. This transformation allows you to parameterize methods with different requests, delay or queue a request's execution, and support undoable operations.

### Key Concepts

1. **Command**: This is an interface or abstract class that declares a method for executing a command. It can also have a method for undoing the command.
2. **Concrete Command**: These are classes that implement the Command interface. They contain a reference to a receiver object and implement the execute method by calling the corresponding action(s) on the receiver.
3. **Receiver**: The object that performs the actual work when the command's execute method is called.
4. **Invoker**: The object that holds a command and at some point asks the command to carry out a request by calling its execute method.
5. **Client**: The client is responsible for creating the command object and associating it with the receiver.

### How It Works

1. **Client creates a command**: The client creates an instance of a concrete command and passes it to the invoker.
2. **Invoker stores the command**: The invoker stores the command object. It doesn't know what the command does, just that it can be executed.
3. **Invoker triggers the command**: When the invoker is asked to perform an action, it calls the execute method on the stored command.
4. **Command calls receiver**: The command object calls methods on the receiver to fulfill the request.


### MVC Design Pattern

The MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern is a way to organize code in a Java application to separate concerns, making the application easier to manage, test, and maintain. Here's a simple breakdown:

1. **Model**:
   - Represents the data and the business logic of the application.
   - It directly manages the data, logic, and rules of the application.
   - For example, in a library application, the `Book` class and methods to add, remove, or update books would be part of the Model.

2. **View**:
   - Represents the user interface (UI) of the application.
   - It displays the data from the Model to the user and sends user commands to the Controller.
   - For example, the web pages or graphical user interfaces (GUIs) that show lists of books would be part of the View.

3. **Controller**:
   - Acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View.
   - It listens to the user input from the View, processes it (e.g., updating data in the Model), and updates the View accordingly.
   - For example, if a user clicks a button to add a new book, the Controller handles this action by updating the Model and then refreshing the View.

### Memento Design Pattern

The Memento Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to capture and save the current state of an object without exposing its internal structure. This pattern is useful for implementing features like undo/redo operations, where you need to revert an object to a previous state.

### Components of the Memento Pattern

1. **Originator**: The object whose state needs to be saved and restored.
2. **Memento**: The object that stores the state of the Originator. It is a simple object with no methods that modify its data.
3. **Caretaker**: The object responsible for storing and restoring the Memento. It does not operate on or examine the contents of the Memento.

### Template Design Pattern

The Template Method Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class but allows subclasses to override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure. This pattern is useful when you have an algorithm with common steps but some of these steps may vary between implementations.

### Components of the Template Method Pattern

1. **Abstract Class (Template Class)**: Defines the template method and basic structure of the algorithm. It contains concrete methods (which provide default behavior) and abstract methods (which subclasses need to implement).
2. **Concrete Classes**: Subclasses that implement the abstract methods defined in the template class, providing specific behavior for the steps that can vary.

### Example 

Let's consider an example where we have an abstract class for a data processor. This processor reads data, processes it, and saves the results. The reading and saving steps are common, but the processing step may vary.

#### Step 1: Create the Abstract Class

The `DataProcessor` class defines the template method `processData()` and provides default implementations for reading and saving data. The `process()` method is abstract and must be implemented by subclasses.

```java
abstract class DataProcessor {
    // Template method
    public final void processData() {
        readData();
        process();
        saveData();
    }

    private void readData() {
        System.out.println("Reading data");
    }

    protected abstract void process();

    private void saveData() {
        System.out.println("Saving data");
    }
}
```

#### Step 2: Create Concrete Classes

Subclasses implement the `process()` method to provide specific behavior.

```java
class TextDataProcessor extends DataProcessor {
    @Override
    protected void process() {
        System.out.println("Processing text data");
    }
}

class ImageDataProcessor extends DataProcessor {
    @Override
    protected void process() {
        System.out.println("Processing image data");
    }
}
```

#### Step 3: Use the Template Method Pattern

Here's how you use these classes together:

```java
public class TemplateMethodPatternDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        DataProcessor textProcessor = new TextDataProcessor();
        textProcessor.processData();

        System.out.println();

        DataProcessor imageProcessor = new ImageDataProcessor();
        imageProcessor.processData();
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Abstract Class (Template Class)**: The `DataProcessor` class defines the `processData()` template method, which outlines the steps of the algorithm. The `readData()` and `saveData()` methods are concrete and provide default behavior. The `process()` method is abstract, allowing subclasses to define their specific processing logic.

2. **Concrete Classes**: The `TextDataProcessor` and `ImageDataProcessor` classes extend `DataProcessor` and implement the `process()` method with specific behavior for processing text and image data, respectively.

3. **Template Method Pattern in Action**: In the `TemplateMethodPatternDemo` class, we create instances of `TextDataProcessor` and `ImageDataProcessor` and call the `processData()` method on each. This method follows the template defined in the `DataProcessor` class, but the actual processing step is handled by the concrete subclasses.

### Benefits of the Template Method Pattern

- **Code Reuse**: Common code is placed in the abstract class, allowing reuse across multiple concrete classes.
- **Enforces a Consistent Algorithm Structure**: The template method ensures that the overall structure of the algorithm remains consistent while allowing specific steps to vary.
- **Simplifies Code Maintenance**: Changes to the common steps of the algorithm need to be made only in the abstract class.
